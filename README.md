# DarlAlexaSkill
Converts a DARL ruleset to an Alexa skill via an Azure Function

This is alpha code. 

Use this code to create an Azure function that acts as an intermediary between the Alexa skills interface and the DARL system found at https://darl.dev.

The ruleset to run is passed in as part of the url.
The invocation and intents are generated by a darl.dev call that returns sample json that can be used with the alexa developer console.

The code is based originally on https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarcoMinerva.AlexaSkillProjectTemplate
